      <p>
        Our physical and emotional health is directly tied to what we eat, and
        the best way to ensure we are getting the highest quality food is to
        prepare it at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a system to organize recipes, plan menus, and compile shopping
        lists, our kitchens will lack the ingredients we need to prepare our
        meals.
      </p>
      Our hope is that Plan to Eat will equip you to prepare delicious, wholesome
      food at home that nourishes both body and soul.
