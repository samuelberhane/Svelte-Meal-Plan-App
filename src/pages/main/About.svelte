                Our physical and emotional health is directly tied to what we
                eat, and the best way to ensure we are getting the highest
                quality food is to prepare it at home.

                Without a system to organize recipes, plan menus, and compile
                shopping lists, our kitchens will lack the ingredients we need
                to prepare our meals.
              </p>
              Our hope is that Plan to Eat will equip you to prepare delicious, wholesome
              food at home that nourishes both body and soul.
